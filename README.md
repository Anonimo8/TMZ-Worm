### PyNumVerifyTool  

**Phone Number Validation with API Layer**  

This project is a Python script designed to validate phone numbers using the API Layer service. **It is only compatible with Linux operating systems.**  

### Description  

The script performs the following tasks:  
1. Prompts the user to input a phone number.  
2. Sends a request to the API Layer service to validate the number.  
3. Saves the API response in a text file named after the input phone number.  
4. Displays the content of the generated file in the terminal.  

### Requirements  
- Linux operating system.  
- Python 3.x installed.  
- Curl installed (a commented line is included to install it if needed).  
- A valid API key for the API Layer service.  

### Features  
- Quick and easy phone number validation.  
- Automatic generation of text files containing validation data.  
- Seamless integration with the API Layer service.  

### Usage  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/ttomiid/PyNumVerifyTool.git  
   ```  
2. Make sure `curl` is installed. If not, install it using:  
   ```bash  
   sudo apt-get install curl  
   ```  
3. Run the script:
